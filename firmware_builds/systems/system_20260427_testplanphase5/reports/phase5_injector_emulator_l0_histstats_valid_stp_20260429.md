## Case Summary

| Case | Run | Source | Mode | Interval | Hist Hits | Hist Drops | MTS Hits | Ring InErr | Real Beats | Emu Beats | Class |
|---:|---:|---|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---|
| 0 | 47040 | `emulator` | `periodic` | 12500 | 29915 | 0 | 23283 | 0 | 3227283929 | 3227283929 | `PASS` |

## Configuration Notes

- The active `mutrig_injector_0` exposes one `coe_inject_pulse` output. The emulator `inject_channel_mask` CSR is still written for visibility, but that mask only affects the separate masked-trigger conduit and is not driven by this injector instance.
- Channel sanity in this report is therefore represented by emulator cluster center/size; ASIC sanity is represented by `active_lanes_mask` and the per-lane source mux selection.
- The runner writes injector mode `0` before setup and immediately after the injection window because the current injector RTL accepts run-control but does not gate the pulse arbiter by RUNNING.
